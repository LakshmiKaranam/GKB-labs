### --> Here I have used the HTML, BOOTSTRAP, CSS, JavaScript, Servlet, JDBC and JSP.
#### --> To get the details from the user, I have used the html and css . 
#### --> To store the form data in the database we need to connect with the database. For that, we should install the mySql Connector, copy the connector from system and paste it in the WEBAPP in the project folder.
#### --> The user entered data will be stored in the database which we used in the servlet code.
#### --> To retrieve the data from the database ,which the user entered in the form, I have used JSP.
#### --> To use JSP, we should install the JSTL ,to make connection, the JSTL Jar file should copy from the system and paste it in the WEBAPP in the project folder.
